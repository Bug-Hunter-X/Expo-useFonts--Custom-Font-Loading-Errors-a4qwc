This bug occurs when using the Expo `useFonts` hook with a custom font that is not properly loaded or configured.  The app might crash or display default fonts instead of the custom ones. This is often due to incorrect font file paths, missing font files, or issues with the font file format.  Another uncommon cause is a race condition where the app tries to render text before the fonts have finished loading.
